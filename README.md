## Week 1

### Context

- Tom Igoe TEDxTalk response:  
    
    It feels very vulnerable to share things that you’ve made on the internet. I’ve felt this way for a multitude of different reasons — including being scared of what others might think, not having confidence in my creations, or even feeling a tinge of selfishness. This TED talk was a good reminder that the practice of sharing and borrowing ideas is at the heart of the most vibrant & creative communities. I loved Tom Igoe’s repetition of the word “conviviality.” It’s a word I don’t hear often, and it’s clear to me now how conviviality & technology go hand in hand. The ending quote especially embodied this thought: “The devices that we make — what they do matters less than the relationships that we make through them & how they change our relationships." Friendliness, liveliness, and openness are all important contributors in creating change & big ideas. 


- Basical Terminal Usage Video commands to remember:
    * ls  (see current directory)
    * cd  (change directory) 
    * cd . . (go up one directory)
    * command+k (clears terminal)
    * cd / (takes you to root directory)
    * mkdir (make directory)
    * rm directory_name (remove directory)
    * rm -r directory_name (remove directory and everything in it)
    * touch index.html (creates new file)
    * open index.html (opens file)
    * up/down arrows toggles through previous commands
    * open . (opens current folder)
    * mv index.html index2.html (rename index.html to inndex2.html)
    * press tab to autocomplete

- Command line activity in Learn Computing: new commands to remember
    * whoami (returns your name)
    * vim hello.txt (create & open text file in vim, press i to type and esc to delete, :wq to save and quit)
    * cat hello.txt (view contents of a file)
    * vim hello.py (create and open text file with py extension)
    * python hello.py (run python script)

The command line is much faster than clicking around in my directories. I'm excited to become more fluent in command line lingo.

- Documentation activity in Learn Computing
    
   One of my biggest regrets is not properly documenting the projects I made in the Davidson in Silicon Valley program. I made a lot of cool stuff but I don't remember the commands to run them or how to access them. This activity emphasized the importance of iteration and shared some really cool resources for documentation. I'll be sure to carefully document what I've learned this semester.

## Week 2

### Context
- Sanjay Sarma The Internet of Things: Roadmap to a Connected World (2016)

    1. 1 quote from the reading(s): "But how “smart” is it to let the IoT pervade everything in our lives, without active and purposeful design?" From a consumer perspective, I can't speak to how smart it is, but it *feels* scary. The biggest challenges of ioT devices — security and privacy — are exactly the values that are most important to me as a consumer. 

    1. 1 related comment on the reading: The quote above reminded me of an article I read by mathematician Federico Ardila–Mantilla  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.10007.pdf . His research is concerned with determining algorithms for the optimal movement of a robot arm in a CAT(0) cubical complex. He brought up one major question: what does it mean to do math ethically? After hearing about how a police officer killed someone using a robot during a protest, he became concerned with how his robot work was being applied. From this article, I was reminded that our research & creations are not disattached from the rest of the world. Our creations can be manipulated to benefit certain groups of people, while harmings others. It's not enough to be well-intentioned; we must also be knowledgeable about the power that our technology can wield in the world. The Sarma article suggests that it is increasingly chaotic to build iOT devices that lack architectural continuity and standards of communnication. To expand upon that, I believe it is not only chaotic, but also possibly dangerous. I think it is an essential part of the creation process to consider the ethics that surround an ioT device's (potentially unexpected) applications.

    1. 1 related follow-up question (what question does it bring up for you?) The article suggests three best practices for "controlling the chaos." My question is: Besides controlling the "architectural" chaos, how can we control the "ethical" or "moral" chaos? What does it mean to "do" technology ethically?

- The Internet of Things has a dirty little secret: it's not really yours (2016)
    
    1. 1 quote from the reading(s) "Not only are the customers buying smart devices cluelessly roped in, if you ask the companies behind the devices you’ll almost always get a vague pipe dream that doesn’t match the reality of connecting your home’s most crucial devices." The creation of countless random ioT devices seems very profit-driven. It's hard for me to tell what products might actual solve a problem in my life, and what products are a simple money-grab. 

    1. 1 related comment on the reading(s) The article seems to suggest a pervading solutionism mindset. A lot of the ioT devices described in this article (such as smart trash cans and umbrellas) assume that a problem exists, assume that the problem behaves in a certain way, and assume a best solution. This process neglects to carefully investigate the subtleties of the problem to understand its best solution — if a problem even exists in the first place. This has the potential to create more unexpected problems.

    1. 1 related follow-up question (what question does it bring up for you?)  It's scary to think that functional household items (such as old-fashioned non-ioT thermostats) could become obsolete in exchange for internet-connected devices that might become quickly outdated as smart technology continues to evolve. My question is: Is it ok to sacrifice advanced technologicaly innovation for simple functionality? In other words, do you think there will there ever come a point when thermostat manufacters, for example, think to themselves, "Ok. We don't need a thermostat more advanced that this. We can stop here." Or is technological innovation too rooted in consumerism to come to this conclusion?

### Experiments

<!-- List each Platt experiment / Monk recipe outcome, adding notes, photos, schematics, captions to show your work. -->

1. Platt, Taste the Power (pg. 7)
    1. 1st photo with a wet tongue, 2nd photo with a dry tongue
    1. ![20220209_105444](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59896196/153240342-fb07eb44-49e7-417f-9f60-3123d09b158e.jpg)
![20220209_105456](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59896196/153240377-a336c5c7-217b-47b2-9688-c6c3b07fdaf1.jpg)
    1. Wet tongue = lower resistence, dry tongue = higher resistance
    1. On a multimeter, the black lead goes with COM, and the red lead goes with V
    1. On a manual multimeter, you need to know what you're measuring so you can choose a range of values.
    1. When electricity travels through a shorter distance, it encounters less resistance (ohms), resulting in increased current (amps).

Platt, Charles. Make: Electronics (p. 10). Make Community, LLC. Kindle Edition. 
    5. Quiz question: How does wet skin effect the flow of electric current?
    1. Answer: Wet skin makes electricity encounter less resistance, so the flow of current increases.
