## Week 1

### Context

- Week 1 Tom Igoe TEDxTalk response:  
    
    It feels very vulnerable to share things that you’ve made on the internet. I’ve felt this way for a multitude of different reasons — including being scared of what others might think, not having confidence in my creations, or even feeling a tinge of selfishness. This TED talk was a good reminder that the practice of sharing and borrowing ideas is at the heart of the most vibrant & creative communities. I loved Tom Igoe’s repetition of the word “conviviality.” It’s a word I don’t hear often, and it’s clear to me now how conviviality & technology go hand in hand. The ending quote especially embodied this thought: “The devices that we make — what they do matters less than the relationships that we make through them & how they change our relationships." Friendliness, liveliness, and openness are all important contributors in creating change & big ideas. 

- Sanjay Sarma The Internet of Things: Roadmap to a Connected World (2016)

    1. 1 quote from the reading(s): "But how “smart” is it to let the IoT pervade everything in our lives, without active and purposeful design?" From a consumer perspective, I can't speak to how smart it is, but it *feels scary. The biggest challenges of ioT devices — security and privacy — are exactly the values that are most important to me as a consumer. 

    1. 1 related comment on the reading: The quote above reminded me of an article I read by mathematician Federico Ardila–Mantilla, available  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.10007.pdf . His research is concerned with determining algorithms for the optimal movement of a robot arm in a CAT(0) cubical complex. He brought up one major question: what does it mean to do math ethically? After hearing about how a police officer killed someone using a robot during a protest, he became concerned with how his work was being applied. From that article, I realized that our research & creations are not disattached from the rest of the world. Our creations can be manipulated to benefit certain groups of people, while harmings others. He suggests that it's not enough to be well-intentioned; we must also be knowledgeable about the power that our technology can wield in the world. The Sarma article suggests that it is increasingly chaotic to build iOT devices that lack architectural continuity and standards of communnication. To expand upon that, I believe it is not only chaotic, but also possibly dangerous. I think it is an essential part of the creation process to consider the ethics that surround an ioT device's (potentially unexpected) applications.

    1. 1 related follow-up question (what question does it bring up for you?) The article suggests three best practices for "controlling the chaos." My question is: Besides controlling the "architectural" chaos, how can we control the "ethical" chaos? What does it mean to "do" technology ethically?
