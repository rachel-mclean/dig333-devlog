## Week 1

### Context

- Week 1 Tom Igoe TEDxTalk response:  
    
    -It feels very vulnerable to share things that you’ve made on the internet. I’ve felt this way for a multitude of different reasons — including being scared of what others might think, not having confidence in my creations, or even feeling a tinge of selfishness. This TED talk was a good reminder that the practice of sharing and borrowing ideas is at the heart of the most vibrant & creative communities. I loved Tom Igoe’s repetition of the word “conviviality.” It’s a word I don’t hear often, and it’s clear to me now how conviviality & technology go hand in hand. The ending quote especially embodied this thought — “The devices that we make — what they do matters less than the relationships that we make through them & how they change our relationships." Friendliness, liveliness, and openness are all important contributors in creating change & big ideas. 

- Sanjay Sarma The Internet of Things: Roadmap to a Connected World (2016)
