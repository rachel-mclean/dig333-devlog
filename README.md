## Week 1

### Context

- Tom Igoe TEDxTalk response:  
    
    It feels very vulnerable to share things that you’ve made on the internet. I’ve felt this way for a multitude of different reasons — including being scared of what others might think, not having confidence in my creations, or even feeling a tinge of selfishness. This TED talk was a good reminder that the practice of sharing and borrowing ideas is at the heart of the most vibrant & creative communities. 
    
    I loved Tom Igoe’s repetition of the word “conviviality.” It’s a word I don’t hear often, and it’s clear to me now how conviviality & technology go hand in hand. The ending quote especially embodied this thought: “The devices that we make — what they do matters less than the relationships that we make through them & how they change our relationships." Friendliness, liveliness, and openness are all important contributors in creating change & big ideas. 
    
    Question: How can "conviviality" be nurted in a classroom?


- Basical Terminal Usage Video commands to remember:
    * ls  (see current directory)
    * cd  (change directory) 
    * cd . . (go up one directory)
    * command+k (clears terminal)
    * cd / (takes you to root directory)
    * mkdir (make directory)
    * rm directory_name (remove directory)
    * rm -r directory_name (remove directory and everything in it)
    * touch index.html (creates new file)
    * open index.html (opens file)
    * up/down arrows toggles through previous commands
    * open . (opens current folder)
    * mv index.html index2.html (rename index.html to inndex2.html)
    * press tab to autocomplete

- Command line activity in Learn Computing: new commands to remember
    * whoami (returns your name)
    * vim hello.txt (create & open text file in vim, press i to type and esc to delete, :wq to save and quit)
    * cat hello.txt (view contents of a file)
    * vim hello.py (create and open text file with py extension)
    * python hello.py (run python script)

The command line is much faster than clicking around in my directories. I'm excited to become more fluent in command line lingo.

- Documentation activity in Learn Computing
    
   One of my biggest regrets is not properly documenting the projects I made in the Davidson in Silicon Valley program. I made a lot of cool stuff but I don't remember the commands to run them or how to access them. This activity emphasized the importance of iteration and shared some really cool resources for documentation. I'll be sure to carefully document what I've learned this semester.

## Week 2

### Context
- Sanjay Sarma The Internet of Things: Roadmap to a Connected World (2016)

    1. 1 quote from the reading(s): "But how “smart” is it to let the IoT pervade everything in our lives, without active and purposeful design?" From a consumer perspective, I can't speak to how smart it is, but it *feels* scary. The biggest challenges of ioT devices — security and privacy — are exactly the values that are most important to me as a consumer. 

    1. 1 related comment on the reading: The quote above reminded me of an article I read by mathematician Federico Ardila–Mantilla  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.10007.pdf . His research is concerned with determining algorithms for the optimal movement of a robot arm in a CAT(0) cubical complex. He brought up one major question: what does it mean to do math ethically? After hearing about how a police officer killed someone using a robot during a protest, he became concerned with how his robot work was being applied. From this article, I was reminded that our research & creations are not disattached from the rest of the world. Our creations can be manipulated to benefit certain groups of people, while harmings others. It's not enough to be well-intentioned; we must also be knowledgeable about the power that our technology can wield in the world. The Sarma article suggests that it is increasingly chaotic to build iOT devices that lack architectural continuity and standards of communnication. To expand upon that, I believe it is not only chaotic, but also possibly dangerous. I think it is an essential part of the creation process to consider the ethics that surround an ioT device's (potentially unexpected) applications.

    1. 1 related follow-up question (what question does it bring up for you?): The article suggests three best practices for "controlling the chaos." My question is: Besides controlling the "architectural" chaos, how can we control the "ethical" or "moral" chaos? What does it mean to "do" technology ethically?

- The Internet of Things has a dirty little secret: it's not really yours (2016)
    
    1. 1 quote from the reading(s): "Not only are the customers buying smart devices cluelessly roped in, if you ask the companies behind the devices you’ll almost always get a vague pipe dream that doesn’t match the reality of connecting your home’s most crucial devices." The creation of countless random ioT devices seems very profit-driven. It's hard for me to tell what products might actual solve a problem in my life, and what products are a simple money-grab. 

    1. 1 related comment on the reading(s): The article seems to suggest a pervading solutionism mindset. A lot of the ioT devices described in this article (such as smart trash cans and umbrellas) assume that a problem exists, assume that the problem behaves in a certain way, and assume a best solution. This process neglects to carefully investigate the subtleties of the problem to understand its best solution — if a problem even exists in the first place. This has the potential to create more unexpected problems.

    1. 1 related follow-up question (what question does it bring up for you?):  It's scary to think that functional household items (such as old-fashioned non-ioT thermostats) could become obsolete in exchange for internet-connected devices that might become quickly outdated as smart technology continues to evolve. My question is: Is it ok to sacrifice advanced technologicaly innovation for simple functionality? In other words, do you think there will there ever come a point when thermostat manufacters, for example, think to themselves, "Ok. We don't need a thermostat more advanced that this. We can stop here." Or is technological innovation too rooted in consumerism to come to this conclusion?

### Experiments

<!-- List each Platt experiment / Monk recipe outcome, adding notes, photos, schematics, captions to show your work. -->

1. Platt, Taste the Power (pg. 7)
    1. Notes
        * <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59896196/153240342-fb07eb44-49e7-417f-9f60-3123d09b158e.jpg" width="300" height="400">
        * <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59896196/153240377-a336c5c7-217b-47b2-9688-c6c3b07fdaf1.jpg" width="300" height="400">
        * Wet tongue = lower resistence, dry tongue = higher resistance
        * On a multimeter, the black lead goes with COM, and the red lead goes with V
        * On a manual multimeter, you need to know what you're measuring so you can choose a range of values.
    1. When electricity travels through a shorter distance, it encounters less resistance (ohms), resulting in increased current (amps).
    1. Quiz question: How does wet skin effect the flow of electric current?
        * Answer: Wet skin makes electricity encounter less resistance, so the flow of current increases.

1. Platt, Let's Abuse a Battery! (pg. 11)
    1. Notes
        * Damaging batteries such as lithium batteries can be dangerous, so be careful.
        * Voltage measures electrical pressure caused by a chemical reaction with electrons
        * Current of electricity is measured in amps, pressure of electricity is measures in volts, resistance to flow measured in ohms.
        * Water analogy of the relationship between electrical current, pressure, and resistance: "Resistance blocks pressure and reduces flow"
    1. Ohm's Law: Voltage = Current x Resistance (V = I x R)
    1. Quiz question: what is the effect of a higher voltage on electrical current?
        * Answer: A higher voltage overcomes resistance more easily and increases the current.

1. Your First Circuit (pg. 18)
    1. Notes
        * <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59896196/153246061-4741215d-f630-4641-a8a9-1bfe4f88fc36.jpg" width="300" height="400">
        * <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59896196/153250635-2f35759b-3097-4cfd-8b0b-486ba1299047.jpg" width="450" height="300">
        * Resistors resist the flow of electricity.
        * The longer wire sticking out of an LED must receive a more positive voltage compared to the shorter wire.
    1. The positive terminal should be on the right side of the battery, connected to the longest wire of the LED (so it receives a more positive voltage).
    1. Quiz question: What is the limit for the current passing into the LED through the long wire?
        * This limit is called the forward limit and is stated by the manufacturer. 

1. Variable Resistance (pg. 21)
    1. Notes
        * <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59896196/153252798-3b995276-2cb7-4e93-b84d-66bf592d297c.jpg" width="450" height="300">
        * Petentiometers help control current.
        * A potentiometer has no polarity (when you switch the red and black probes' positions against the potentiometer, the resistance measured on a multimeter stays the same — it does not switch from negative to positive or positive to negative.)
        * You can turn the shaft of a potentiometer clockwise to control the brightness of your LED.
        * Potential difference = voltage between two points.
        * You can check voltage across parts of a circuit by touching the black and red probes to different parts of the circuit.
        * To measure current in a circuit, you need to insert your multimeter into the circuit itself.
        * Ohm's Law: volts = amps x ohms
            * I = V / R
            * R = V / I
    1. The current is the same at all points in the circuit, while the sum of the potential differences across the different parts of the circuit should add to the voltage of the battery.
    4. Quiz question: If the potentiometer has a lower resistance, what happens to the total resistance in the circuit?
        * Answer: The total resistance in the circuit is also lower, and more current can flow.

1. Let's Make a Battery
    1. Notes
        * watts = volts x amps
        * V = W / I
        * I = W / V
    1. Two batteries in series deliver twice the voltage, while two batteries in parallel deliver either "the same current for twice as long or twice the current for the same amount of time."
    1. If resistance in a circuit remains the same, how will increased voltage effect current?
        * Since I = V / R, increasing voltage increases current (amperage).

## Week 3

### Context

- THE CRITICAL ENGINEERING MANIFESTO
    1. Summarize the article(s) in 3-4 sentences: This manifesto describes a list of axioms that every engineer should examine. These statements seem to highlight the importance of critical thinking within the field of engineering. The statements examine how engineering transforms the world, how engineering threatens the world, how engineering impacts the people who use technology, and how engineering is inspired.  
 
    1. 1 quote from the reading(s): "The Critical Engineer looks to the history of art, architecture, activism, philosophy and invention and finds exemplary works of Critical Engineering. Strategies, ideas and agendas from these disciplines will be adopted, re-purposed and deployed." This quote emphasizes how engineering is not disattached from the rest of the world. It intersects with multitudes of other field and is strengthened, beautified, and informed by other disciplines.

    1. 1 related comment on the reading(s): I was interested to hear the way this manifesto framed technology within a dichotomy. The 1st statement characterizes "any technology depended upon" as both an aid and a threat. Similarly, in the 2nd statement I was surprised to hear that technological advancement challenges our technology literacy, a threat I had not yet considered. These statements encourage engineers to critically consider both the inner workings and the material effects of technology.
    
    1. 1 related follow-up question (what question does it bring up for you?): What do you think is meant by the last axiom — "The Critical Engineer considers the exploit to be the most desirable form of exposure." The word exploit usually has a negative connotation, but it seems to be framed positively in this statement. Perhaps the statement is suggesting that the sharing, borrowing, or even stealing of engineering/coding ideas is a necessary phenomenon? Would you go as far as to say that this phenomenon is desirable?

- Artist Profile: Julian Oliver
    1. Summarize the article(s) in 3-4 sentences: This reading was an interview-style article with Julian Oliver, one author of the Critical Engineering Manifesto. He claims that engineering is integral to all of our human behaviors. He also critiques the lack of transparency in the infrastructure of many technological advancements, and the impact of these obscurities.
 
    1. 1 quote from the reading(s): "Our inability to describe and understand reduces our critical reach, leaving us both disempowered and, quite often, vulnerable." This quote clarified the 2nd manifesto statement for me, which says that each technological advancement challenges our techno-political literacy. I see now that techno-political literacy is related to our ability to describe what the technology is doing for us and how its infrastructure is set up. When we can't verbalize these things, we are vulnerable to being taken advantage of.

    1. 1 related comment on the reading(s): Oliver makes a bold statement that Engineering, not Art, is the most transformative language of our time. I'm still not sure to what extent I agree with this, but I appreciate the perspective that Engineering is a language. I would maybe be more inclined to agree with the statement Engineering *is* Art, in some way?
    
    1. 1 related follow-up question (what question does it bring up for you?): Oliver uses the phrase, "Engendering a healthy paranoia." Do you think the Critical Engineering Manifesto is supporting a healthy paranoia? What would healthy paranoia look like, on a day-to-day basis?

## Week 4

### Context
- Pay for the Printer by Philip Dick
    1. Summarize the article(s) in 3-4 sentences. This story describes the state of a dystopian world after an alien race called the Biltong begin to weak, after being relied upon too heavilty by the human race to produce or "print" human artifacts. The world is characterized as being in a state of decay, and the Biltong can no longer reproduce or "spawn." The humans in the story are surprised to learn that people are still capable of creating things.
 
    1. 1 quote from the reading(s): "The word froze all four of them. Chicago, the settlement that had collapsed! ... Sooner or later, what had happened to the Chicago settlement would happen to them all." This quote stood out to me because I'm from Chicago. The suggestion of Chicago falling into a state of dystopian collapse hit home more than the other descriptions. With the onset of climate change and irreversiible environmental damage, I wonder how far off this future is. Or, as the story more directly suggests, human reliance or exploitation of technology could also bring about this future.
    

    1. As I began reading this, I was a little disoriented. The state of the world was implied instead of outwardly explained. As I adjusted to the meaning of "Biltong", "settlement", "print", etc, I began to enjoy the story. The dystopian qualities of this world hit the reader in the face. Every sentence is filled with dreary descriptions of a frighteningly abysmal reality. It seems that this reality was brought upon by human dependency on the Biltong to produce all resources. This story suggests that human dependency on technology could end badly, and that 
    
    1. 1 related follow-up question (what question does it bring up for you?): Another quote from the reading(s): "You made this knife?" Fergesson asked, dazed. "I can't believe it. Where do you start? You have to have tools to make this. It's a paradox!" His voice rose with hysteria. "It isn't possible!" Fergesson's hysteria is very ominous. It suggests that humans lost their craftmanship and the ability to create their own tools. It brings up the question — how can we balance technological advancement with the maintanence of own our craftmanshp/skillset? Like languages, it seems that certain skills would become obselete and unknowable once technology replaces them. Can we create technological advances without causing a multi-generational regression our own human capabilities?
